# DeepLRR
An online webserver for leucine-rich-repeat containing protein characterization based on deep learning.

We introduce our method DeepLRR based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and LRR features, for predicting number and location of LRR unit in LRR proteins. We compared DeepLRR to six existing methods on a dataset containing 874 LRR proteins, and DeepLRR outperformed the competing methods in overall F1-score. In addition, DeepLRR has integrated the pipeline of identifying plant disease-resistance proteins (NLR、RLK、RLP) and atypical domains.
